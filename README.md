# UFOs

## Project Overview

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis. <br>
This project was to create update Dana's website about UFO sightings. The website initially let users filter sightings by date and the update from this project let users filter on more attributes (by city, state, country and/or shape of UFO). Another big update from this project was the website's reaction to the user's filter selection. 

## Results
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation. <br>

This project update the webpage by making the Filter Search more sophisticated than before. In this new webpage, users are able to filter not only by date but by city, state, country and/or shape of UFO. Users can choose to filter by one of these attributes or two attributes, etc. <br>
<br>
The table reacts to the values inputted by the clients and the table updates almost instantaneously as to when the user enter a value in one of the filters. This is new compared to prior where the users have to click on the Search button to update the table.

## Summary
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development. <br>
A drawback of this new design would be the lack of guidance on the values to input in the search boxes. I'm not sure if it's really intuitive to know the exact value/syntax the table has (e.g. for filtering for state, a user can input California and never get any results back because "California" does not exist in the table). I think it would be good to have a dropdown option for this instance. It will make for a better selection experience. The other thing I would add would be a note saying "results not found" on the table portion of the webpage so that it's explicit to the users that their search is not found in the dataset.
